## Java OOP Concepts

### Classes and Objects
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) common to all objects of the same type.
- **Object**: An instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and encapsulates its state and behavior.

### Inheritance
- **Inheritance**: The mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and behavior from another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

### Polymorphism
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of objects to take on different forms based on their types or parent classes. It enables method overriding and method overloading.

### Encapsulation
- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to the data and ensures data integrity.

### Abstraction
- **Abstraction**: The process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features of an object. It enables the creation of abstract classes and interfaces.

## Getting Started with Java OOP

### Setting Up Your Environment
- Install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system.
- Set up a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

### Creating Classes and Objects
- Define classes with attributes and methods.
- Instantiate objects from classes using the `new` keyword.

### Implementing Inheritance
- Create a subclass that extends a superclass.
- Override methods in the subclass to provide specialized behavior.

### Understanding Polymorphism
- Utilize method overriding to provide different implementations of methods in subclasses.
- Apply method overloading to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

### Applying Encapsulation
- Declare class fields as private to restrict direct access.
- Provide getter and setter methods to access and modify private fields.

### Utilizing Abstraction
- Create abstract classes with abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.
- Implement interfaces to define a contract for classes.
